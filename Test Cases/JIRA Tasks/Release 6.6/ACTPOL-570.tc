   <description>In file KPSLPF0044, a new set of OPV codes are being used, so we need to be able to hide the old ones. As we cannot just delete them, because they have been used previously and still need to be displayed in 'old' fines, we have defined field OBVFLG2 as the field to determine whether the opv should be shown or not. 

 

J  = active, show when displaying the select OPV code screen

N = inactive, do not show when displaying the select OPV code screen

 

Related to this, the following program should be adjusted: POL10001

Please check if something must be done for POL10003 also, not sure.

 

Testing Steps:

Open any assistentie and go to tab Proces
Select rol/proces 'Bekeurde Persoon'
Soort procesverbaal = Oproepingsproces-verbaal
Transportmiddel = Voertuig
Go to accordeon Strafbaar feit and click on NEW
ONLY records were OBVFLG2 = 'J' should be displayed</description>
