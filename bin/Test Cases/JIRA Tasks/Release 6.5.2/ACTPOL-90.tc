   <description>User has somehow inserted a person with birth date 27/03/1070 (a typo for 1970, we assume)
When creating a PV aangifte (or I guess any document) for this person, this error message as can be seen in attached document appears due to this erroneous birth date.

Is there any way to avoid this from appearing/happening ?

Either a message that doc cannot be created because of the erroneous birth date or still create the doc even with the erroneous birth date.

 

Test Plan:

Menu, click on Generiek
click on Assistentie
In DEV: open assistentie 200601644 in edit mode
click on tab Rol/Proces. I already added an aangifte where mr Wambimba has an erroneous birth date 01/02/1056
create the following document: XML PV AANGIFTE. (Notice the error message. After the fix user should not receive this error message anymore)</description>
